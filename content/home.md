faqs:
  - question: "Is Meaty Meets free to use?"
    answer: "Yes, Meaty Meets is free to use."
  - question: "Do you store my data on your servers?"
    answer: "No, we do not store any data on our servers. Everything is stored in the browser, so you can enjoy the convenience of our service without sacrificing your privacy."
  - question: "Why automatically open meetings?"
    answer: "We are inundated with notifications through-out the day and upcoming meeting notifications are a majority of them. If we are going to join them anyway, why not automatically open it for us. We always have the option to close the tab if we choose not to join. Moreover, creating a habit amongst your team to join few minutes early to chit-chat non-work related topics can create better bond and act as an ice-breaker."
  - question: "Why open attachments?"
    answer: "More often than not, our meetings involve going through an agenda, presenting slides or taking notes. You can enable opening attachments so that you donâ€™t have to go back to the meeting invite to look through the attachments and open them after the meeting has begun."
